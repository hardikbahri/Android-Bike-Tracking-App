# Android Bike Tracking App

This Android app is designed to track a bike's movement and display real-time GPS data, speed, distance traveled, and accelerometer data. It utilizes the FusedLocationProviderClient to retrieve GPS location updates and the accelerometer sensor to detect the bike's movement.

# Features

Speed and Distance Tracking: The app calculates and displays the bike's current speed (in m/s) and the total distance traveled (in meters).

Accelerometer Data: The app reads accelerometer data to detect the bike's movement and determine the direction of movement (forward or backward).
